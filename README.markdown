# KeralaJS

This repository contains the source code for KeralaJS.org website.

KeralaJS is a JavaScript user group and developer community from God's own country. Our goal is to *be* the platform for JavaScript and front-end developers to connect, network and share their experiences. We'll have monthly meetups and occational events mainly focusing on JavaScript and different front-end technologies.
