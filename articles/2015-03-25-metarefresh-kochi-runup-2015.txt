Hello Everyone,

**What is MetaRefresh?**

Meta Refresh is a conference for working web designers and developers to present on how their own work has advanced the state of the web in the past year. You are expected to present original work that your peers — this event’s audience — recognise as being notable enough to deserve a stage.

HasGeek, the organizers of Metaregresh, is a Bangalore based technology startup that creates discussion spaces for geeks. They enable platforms for like-minded people in the verticals of technology to meet-up, interact, share and learn new stuff and identify opportunities for collaboration.

Each year, HasGeek organizes five large technology conferences around specific problem areas and domains. Their next conference Meta Refresh is on front-end and UI engineering and UX on April 16 and 17, happening in Bangalore. Meta Refresh 2015 will focus on enhancing web experience on mobile devices.

HasGeek conferences are totally crowd sourced and community driven. If you'd like to showcase your work, conduct a workshop, talk about open source technology, submit proposals for 45 min, 15 min and Hands-on/ Demo  sessions. Please explore the MetaRefresh Talkfunnel to know more about the themes and expectations for this year:
