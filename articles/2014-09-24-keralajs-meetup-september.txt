## Summary

Thanks everyone for making this a great event. Hope everyone enjoyed the sessions.

The meetup started with the introduction of KeralaJS to the new attendees. Then went on to [Akhil Stanislavose](https://github.com/akhilstanislavose)'s talk on [Variadic function](http://slides.com/akhilstanislavose/variadic-functions-in-javascript). This talk was actually not listed in the meetup announcement. So for most of us it was a surprise. In his session, Akhil gave an in-depth idea of variadic functions, functions which takes any number of arguments and specialties of `arguments` object.

After the networking break, [Revath S Kumar](http://blog.revathskumar.com/) talked on [Unit testing with mocha](https://speakerdeck.com/revathskumar/testing-with-mocha). In that he explained about how to get started with testing JavaScript. 

Then we had a discussion, in which [Praveen Sridhar](http://psbots.blogspot.in/) introduced [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) and [POSSE](http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE) to us. Overall the event was fun and informative as always. Looking forwared to the next month meetup.

We would like to thank [MobME Wireless](http://mobme.in/) for hosting the event and [Akhil Stanislavose](https://github.com/akhilstanislavose) for setting things up for us.

**Cheers**
