We had our first meetup of KeralaJS on 27th October 2013 at Cochin HackerSpace and officially launched the user group. There was a turn-out of 20 developers from different companies and start-ups based out of Kochi. 

There were 3 sessions planned with time alloted for lightning talks. Registration was open till 2:00PM and the event kick-started with Shameer C giving an introduction to KeralaJS and it's plans for the future. It was followed by a talk on “[Introduction to NodeJs](http://www.slideshare.net/shijucv/introduction-to-node-js-27648944)” by Shiju Varghese until 3:30PM and the session encouraged a lot of interaction from the attendees. The next session, “[JavaScript for everyone](http://blog.shameerc.com/talks/javascript-for-everyone.html)” was taken by Shameer C and he talked about how one could use JavaScript in a wide variety of domain ranging from web development to controlling robots. A short session on “[Promises in JavaScript](http://revathskumar.github.io/keralajs-promises/)” followed it, and Revath S Kumar talked about the asynchronous nature of the programming language and how “promises” help developers to build apps which would utilize this feature. The last session of the day was a lightning talk by Praseed Pai, and he delivered an  interesting talk on the functional aspects of  JavaScript Programming.

The talks were over by 5:30PM and snacks and drinks were provided for the attendees. Many of the attendees decided to stay back for some more time for networking with others. Overall, the event was a success and another one is being planned for the following month.

Thanks to all attendees who came for our first meetup and making it a great event!
